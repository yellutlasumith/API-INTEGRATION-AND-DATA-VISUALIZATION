DESCRIPTION OF MY TASK(API Integration and Data Visualization Using Python)

This project demonstrates API integration and data visualization using Python, as part of a hands-on learning task. The main goal is to work with real-time weather data for a specific location (Anantapur) using the OpenWeatherMap API, and visually represent the data using Python libraries.

This task was designed to give practical experience in:

Connecting Python code to a third-party API

Fetching real-time data from the internet

Processing and handling JSON responses

Presenting data visually using graphs

It introduces the foundational principles needed to develop data-driven applications and helps build essential skills useful in software development, data analysis, and machine learning pipelines.

Objective
The main objective of this task is to:

Connect to a weather API (OpenWeatherMap) using Python

 Fetch live weather data for the city of Anantapur

 Create a simple visualization of key weather parameters using Matplotlib

This exercise aims to strengthen the understanding of real-time data integration and basic visualization techniques using Python.

 Tools & Technologies Used
Python: The main programming language used for writing the script.

OpenWeatherMap API: A free API service that provides real-time weather information in JSON format.

Visual Studio Code (VS Code): The code editor used to write, test, and run the Python script.

Requests Library: Used to make HTTP GET requests to the API.

Matplotlib: A Python library used to create bar charts for data visualization.
  Implementation Steps
API Key Setup:

Sign up on https://openweathermap.org and generate a free API key.

This key is required to authenticate API requests.

Fetching Weather Data:

Use Python's requests library to send a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API.

The request includes the city name (Anantapur,IN) and the API key.

The API returns weather information in JSON format.

Extracting Data:

Parse the JSON response to extract:

Temperature

Humidity

Wind speed

Weather description

Store the extracted data in a Python dictionary.

Error Handling:

Implement error handling for scenarios like:

Invalid city name

Expired or incorrect API key

API rate limits or connection issues

Data Visualization:

Use matplotlib to create a bar chart showing:

Temperature

Humidity

Wind Speed

Customize the chart with:

Labels

Gridlines

Title (including weather description)

Color-coded bars for clarity

 Key Outcomes
 Practical API Usage: Learn how to call external APIs from Python and process live data.

 Working with JSON: Understand how to extract and manage structured data in JSON format.

 Data Visualization Skills: Learn how to build basic charts using matplotlib.

 Real-Time Data Handling: Experience the challenges of working with live data, such as connection errors and API limits.

 Real-World Applications
The skills and concepts learned from this task can be applied in:

Building weather dashboards

Creating IoT-based environmental monitoring systems

Developing smart city analytics

Running climate trend analysis

Building mobile or web weather apps

 Conclusion
In this task, I developed a Python-based mini application that retrieves live weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API for Anantapur and displays it using simple bar charts. I learned how to:

Integrate an external API into a Python program

Fetch and process real-time JSON data

Visualize key parameters like temperature and humidity

This task helped reinforce my understanding of data pipelines and how Python can be used in real-world projects involving live data and visualization.
